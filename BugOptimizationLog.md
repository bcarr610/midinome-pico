### Bugs
- [ ] - Metronome click starts a little weird. I would expect the first audible metronome click after recording to be on the downbeat of 5 but it starts immediately after 3 or 4.

### Improvements / Optimizations
- Refactored Audio Conversion to reduce Wav File Size from 7988 bytes -> ~450 bytes
- Refactored Metronome Audio Play to reduce ~115ms iteration time -> 1ms
